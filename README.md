# Enigma

Functionality 
- I think my functionality falls right below meets expectations. I was able to implement everything required except for being able to use special characters. If there are special characters in the message it will break the system. So, for now, the axis armies will have to write without punctuation. 
Object Oriented Programming 
- I believe this meets expectations. I only used one class to keep the project simple, but I broke it up into logical methods. If I was to redo this, I would work on figuring out how to make multiple classes and split it up even more. For now, one class works fine. 
Ruby Conventions and Mechanics 
- Ruby convention meets expectation. I have a few methods that are way over 10 lines and know that they are not acceptable in the real world. Honestly, I ran out of time before I could really refactor them. 
Test Driven Development 
- Meets expectation. I have a test for everything.
Version Control  
- Meets expectation. I have 30 commits and created multiple branches that handled different parts of the project.
